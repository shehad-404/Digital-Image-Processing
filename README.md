# Digital-Image-Processing

## Introduction
**Our project, "Image Gradient and Edge Detection in Image Processingâ€œ, focuses on detecting edges in images by analyzing changes in color or brightness (gradients). Edge detection highlights boundaries and shapes, helping in tasks like object recognition and image analysis. We explore techniques like Laplacian, Sobel, and Canny Edge Detection to find and enhance these edges.**

## Purpose of project
- Understand and apply edge detection techniques to identify shapes and boundaries in images.
- Analyze image gradients (changes in brightness or color) to highlight important areas.
- Enhance object recognition by making edges and contours more visible.

## Run this Python File Step-by-step Guide for VS Code:
### 1. Install Python and Libraries:
- Ensure Python is installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Open the terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

### 2. Open VS Code:
- Launch VS Code and open the folder where you want to save your script.
- Create a new Python file (e.g., Image_Gradient_and_Edge_Detection.py) and copy-paste the code into it.

### 3. Add the Image File:
- Ensure the image file (Captain.jpg) is in the same directory as your Python script or provide the correct path to it.

### 4. Run the Script:
- Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + `` or View > Terminal).
- Run the script by typing:
```
python image_gradient.py
```

### 5. View Outputs:
- The script will open multiple image windows for display, and the processed images will be saved in the current directory.
- Close the image windows by pressing any key or using the close button.


## Run this Python File Step-by-step Guide for Spyder in Anaconda:
### 1. Install Python and Libraries:
- Ensure Python is installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Make sure Python is installed and install the required libraries as mentioned above.

### 2. Open Spyder:
- Launch Spyder (usually installed as part of the Anaconda distribution or independently).
- Create a new file and paste the code into the editor.

### 3. Add the Image File:
- Place Captain.jpg in the working directory of Spyder or specify the full path in the code.

### 4. Run the Script:
- Press the green Run button or use the F5 key to execute the code.

### 5. Interact with the Windows:
- The image windows will pop up. Interact as needed, then close them to end the program.

# Digital-Image-Processing

## Introduction
**Our project, "Image Gradient and Edge Detection in Image Processingâ€œ, focuses on detecting edges in images by analyzing changes in color or brightness (gradients). Edge detection highlights boundaries and shapes, helping in tasks like object recognition and image analysis. We explore techniques like Laplacian, Sobel, and Canny Edge Detection to find and enhance these edges.**

## Purpose of project
- Understand and apply edge detection techniques to identify shapes and boundaries in images.
- Analyze image gradients (changes in brightness or color) to highlight important areas.
- Enhance object recognition by making edges and contours more visible.

# Digital-Image-Processing
**Our project, "Image Gradient and Edge Detection in Image Processingâ€œ, focuses on detecting edges in images by analyzing changes in color or brightness (gradients). Edge detection highlights boundaries and shapes, helping in tasks like object recognition and image analysis. We explore techniques like Laplacian, Sobel, and Canny Edge Detection to find and enhance these edges.**
